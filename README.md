# Delta-Notch
Simulation of cell differentiation driven by Delta-Notch system using Javascript.

The simulation is available <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Aidar-Shagiyev/Delta-Notch/blob/master/delta_notch.html" target="_blank">here</a> (although for whatever reason it may appear broken; refreshing/resizing the window usually solves the problems). For authentic experience clone the repository and open the HTML file with a web browser of your choosing (I tested it in Chrome, but any browser should suffice).

## A little bit of Biology
One of the possible strategies to fine-tune differentition pattern is lateral inhibition â€”- a type of cell-cell interaction whereby a cell that adopts a particular fate inhibits its immediate neighbours from doing likewise (e.g. nascent neural cells inhibit their neighbours from becoming one).

One of the ways to achieve lateral inhibition is through Delta-Notch system: when Delta protein is present on the cell's surface, it interacts with Notch protein of a neighbouring cell starting a signaling cascade which, among other things, inhibits exposition of Delta protein. Thus, there is a positive feedback loop: more Delta on a cell --> more Notch signaling in a neighbour --> less Delta on the neighbour --> less Notch signaling in the cell --> more Delta on the cell. This results in the following pattern: lonely cells without active Notch signaling (and lots of Delta) surrounded by cells with active Notch signaling (and almost no Delta).

## Model
The model is completely yoinked from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1006/jtbi.1996.0233" target="_blank">this paper</a>.

Each cell has two parameters: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d">, which represents how many Delta molecules are available on the cell's surface for neighbours to see, and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">, which represents strength of Notch signaling (and thus strength of inhibition of Delta). Their values lie in the range from 0 to 1, where 0 coresponds to total lack of Delta molecules on the surface/Notch signaling and 1 corresponds to the maximum possible number of Delta molecules/strength of Notch signaling (which are dictated by degradation speed). The authors derived following equations:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\dot{n} = f(\bar{d}) - n">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\dot{d} = v * (g(n) - d)">

where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\bar{d}"> is the average <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d"> of the neighbours, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=v"> is the ratio of degradation speeds of Delta and Notch, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f"> is a continuous increasing function which represents uplift in Notch production in response to neighbours' Delta molecules, and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=g"> is a continuous decreasing function which represents drop in Delta exposition in response to rising levels of Notch signaling. The authors used the following functions:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(x)=\frac{x^{k}}{a %2B x^{k}}">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=g(x)=\frac{1}{1 %2B bx^{k}}">
